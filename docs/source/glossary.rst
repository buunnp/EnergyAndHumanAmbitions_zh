    Watt
     \(W) is a unit of :term:`power`, defined so that 1 W is 1 J/s (one :term:`Joule` per second).

    power
     is the rate of :term:`energy`, or change in energy per change in time. The units are :term:`Joules<Joule>` per second (J/s), or :term:`Watts<Watt>` (W).

    Big Bang
     is the name given to the start of the universe, about 13.8 billion years in the past. 
     
    infrared radiation
     is the property that all objects glow in light, or :term:`electromagnetic radiation`. For objects that are not “red hot,” the emission is invisible to the human eye, at longer :term:`wavelengths<wavelength>` than the visible spectrum. The :term:`power` radiated obeys the :term:`Stefan-Boltzmann law`.

    electromagnetic radiation
     refers to any transport of energy by electromagnetic waves, which include light, ultraviolet, infrared, X-rays, microwaves, gamma rays, and radio waves. 

    Stefan-Boltzmann law
     says that the :term:`power` emitted from a surface of area, 𝐴, and temperature, 𝑇 will be 𝑃 = 𝐴𝜎𝑇\ :sup:`4`, where 𝜎 is the :term:`Stefan-Boltzmann constant`.

    Stefan-Boltzmann constant
     (𝜎) has a value of 5.67 × 10\ :sup:`-8` W/m\ :sup:`2`/K\ :sup:`4` and is used in the :term:`Stefan-Boltzmann law` relating to :term:`infrared radiation`.

     inaction. Plots of human population, atmospheric CO\ :sub:`2`, energy use, all tend to show this 2
     characteristic—which resembles an exponential curve.

     square, or the natural logarithm undoes the exponential.

    Gppl
     is a short-hand unit for giga-people, or billion people.

    negative feedback
     involves a reaction to some stimulus in the direction opposite the stimulus, performing a corrective action and leading to stability. Systems in equilibrium must have negative feedback keeping them there.

    carrying capacity
     refers to the limiting population that can be supported long-term by the environment. No consensus exists for Earth’s carrying capacity for humans, though standards of living have a large influence.

    differential equation
     is an equation that relates functions and their derivatives. The subject is often sequenced after calculus within a curriculum.

    logistic
     describes a mathematical model in which rate of growth depends on how close the population is to the :term:`carrying capacity`. The resulting population curve over time is called the logistic function, or more informally, an S-curve. 

    overshoot
     occurs when the :term:`negative feedback` in a system is delayed. After surpassing the equilibrium, oscillation may ensue. 

    Green Revolution
     refers to the modernization of agricultural practices worldwide beginning around 1950, when fossil fuels transformed both fertilization and mechanization.

     phenomena). The units are Hertz, or 1/s. 

    R/P ratio
     or reserves-to-production ratio is a means to assess time remaining for a resource of quantity R units, being used (produced) at a rate of P units per year.

     (𝛾) is when a :term:`nucleus` in an energetically excited state emits a high-energy :term:`photon`.

    heat pump
     is a device that moves thermal energy from a cold environment to a hotter one, against normal flow. Some energy input is required to drive this reverse flow,

     in which case its duty cycle is 40%.

    heat engine
