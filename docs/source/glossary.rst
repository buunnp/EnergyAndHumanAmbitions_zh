    Watt
     \(W) is a unit of :term:`power`, defined so that 1 W is 1 J/s (one :term:`Joule` per second).

    power
     is the rate of :term:`energy`, or change in energy per change in time. The units are :term:`Joules<Joule>` per second (J/s), or :term:`Watts<Watt>` (W).

    Joule
     \(J) is the SI unit of work or energy, and is equivalent to :term:`Newtons<Newton>` times meters (N·m), or kg · m\ :sup:`2`/s\ :sup:`2`

    energy
     is defined as the capacity to do work. The SI unit is the :term:`Joule`.
    
    Newton
     \(N) is the SI unit of force, and is equivalent to kg · m/s\ :sup:`2`

    work
     is a mechanical expression of :term:`energy`, defined as a force (:term:`Newtons<Newton>`) times distance (meters) through which the force acts (along the same direction). The resulting unit is the :term:`Joule`.

    Big Bang
     is the name given to the start of the universe, about 13.8 billion years in the past. 
     
    infrared radiation
     is the property that all objects glow in light, or :term:`electromagnetic radiation`. For objects that are not “red hot,” the emission is invisible to the human eye, at longer :term:`wavelengths<wavelength>` than the visible spectrum. The :term:`power` radiated obeys the :term:`Stefan-Boltzmann law`.

    electromagnetic radiation
     refers to any transport of energy by electromagnetic waves, which include light, ultraviolet, infrared, X-rays, microwaves, gamma rays, and radio waves. 

    Stefan-Boltzmann law
     says that the :term:`power` emitted from a surface of area, 𝐴, and temperature, 𝑇 will be 𝑃 = 𝐴𝜎𝑇\ :sup:`4`, where 𝜎 is the :term:`Stefan-Boltzmann constant`.

    Stefan-Boltzmann constant
     (𝜎) has a value of 5.67 × 10\ :sup:`-8` W/m\ :sup:`2`/K\ :sup:`4` and is used in the :term:`Stefan-Boltzmann law` relating to :term:`infrared radiation`.

    greenhouse gas
     (GHG) absorbs infrared radiation and acts as a thermal blanket in a planetary atmosphere. H\ :sub:`2`\ O, CO\ :sub:`2`, and CH\ :sub:`4` are powerful greenhouse gases.

    energy intensity
     measures the energy use of a society relative to its economic scale. A typical value may be about 5 MJ/$.

    decoupling
     is the notion that economic activities need not incur a large energy or resource cost, breaking the tendency for economic scale to be tightly coupled to physical goods.

    substitution
     refers to interchangeability between goods and services, so that an unavailable or inferior resource can be replaced by an alternative, possibly superior one.

    CFL
     compact fluorescent light.

    LED
     light emitting diode.

    fossil fuel
     refers to an energy source buried in the ground, in the form of coal (solid), petroleum (liquid), or natural gas (gaseous). Fossil fuels represent ancient solar energy captured in living matter, processed and stored underground over millions of years.

    doubling time
     is how long it takes a system or collection to double its amount under conditions of growth, such as in :term:`exponential growth`.

    exponential growth
     happens when the rate of growth—as a percentage or fraction—is constant. 

    Jevons paradox
     is named after early economist William Stanley Jevons, and describes the backfire of efficiency improvements leading to *increased* usage of the associated resource due to greater demand for the more attractive, efficient technology. Also called the :term:`rebound effect`. 

    rebound effect
     describes the counterintuitive process by which efficiency improvements lead to greater use of the resource as the enhanced appeal and lower cost results in more widespread adoption and use. Also called the :term:`Jevons paradox`. 

    GDP
     Gross Domestic Product, effectively representing the total monetary flow of goods and serviceswithin a society, typically over a one year period.

    hockey stick
     is a term used to describe plots that suddenly shoot up after a very long time of relative
     inaction. Plots of human population, atmospheric CO\ :sub:`2`, energy use, all tend to show this 2
     characteristic—which resembles an exponential curve.

    inverse function
     is a mathematical operation that “undoes” its counterpart, like the square root undoes the
     square, or the natural logarithm undoes the exponential.

    Gppl
     is a short-hand unit for giga-people, or billion people.

    negative feedback
     involves a reaction to some stimulus in the direction opposite the stimulus, performing a corrective action and leading to stability. Systems in equilibrium must have negative feedback keeping them there.

    carrying capacity
     refers to the limiting population that can be supported long-term by the environment. No consensus exists for Earth’s carrying capacity for humans, though standards of living have a large influence.

    differential equation
     is an equation that relates functions and their derivatives. The subject is often sequenced after calculus within a curriculum.

    logistic
     describes a mathematical model in which rate of growth depends on how close the population is to the :term:`carrying capacity`. The resulting population curve over time is called the logistic function, or more informally, an S-curve. 

    overshoot
     occurs when the :term:`negative feedback` in a system is delayed. After surpassing the equilibrium, oscillation may ensue. 

    Green Revolution
     refers to the modernization of agricultural practices worldwide beginning around 1950, when fossil fuels transformed both fertilization and mechanization.

    demographic transition
     refers to the process in which an undeveloped country initially having high birth rate and high death rate transitions to low death rates followed by low birth rates as medical and resource conditions improve.

    terraforming
     is the speculative idea of transforming the atmosphere and environment of a planet hostile to
     human life into one that is suited to human needs. 

    heat loss rate
     as used in this book is the power per Δ𝑇 (in ◦C) required to maintain a temperature differential.
     Units are W/◦C, and typical houses might be a few hundred W/◦C.

    electromagnetic spectrum
     refers to the sweep of wavelengths or frequencies of :term:`electromagnetic radiation`,
     including light, ultraviolet, infrared, X-rays, microwaves, gamma rays, and radio waves. 

    photon
     is the smallest indivisible particle of light: a minimum quantum packet of :term:`energy`.
     Each photon has a well defined energy, which can also be expressed as a :term:`wavelength` or :term:`frequency`.

    wavelength
     measures the length of a wave from crest to crest or trough to trough, and can apply to waves in water, air (sound), or electromagnetic waves (light).
     The symbol 𝜆 (lambda) is often used to denote wavelength. The units are length (m), often expressed in :term:`microns<micron>` (𝜇m). 

    micron
     (𝜇m) is 10\ :sup:`−6` meters, or a micro-meter. 

    frequency
     characterizes the number of cycles per second in a periodic phenomenon (often in wave
     phenomena). The units are Hertz, or 1/s. 

    R/P ratio
     or reserves-to-production ratio is a means to assess time remaining for a resource of quantity R units, being used (produced) at a rate of P units per year.
     The result is years available at the present rate, absent discovery of additional resources or change in rate of use. 

    EIA
     Energy Information Administration.
    
    Annual Energy Review
    AER
     is compiled by the U.S. :term:`EIA`, capturing energy use and trends for all sources and sectors.

    British thermal unit
    Btu
     is a unit of energy in the Imperial unit system, defined as the amount of energy required ◦
     to heat one pound of water by 1 °F. It is equivalent to 1,055 Joules. 

    SI
     Système International. 

    thermal equivalent
     is a construct used to compare thermal energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas to sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectricity, which do not derive from thermal sources.
     Usually in the context of electricity production, multiplying by about 2.7 puts non-thermal sources into thermal-equivalent terms.
